  - adjust the video plain size/ratio to display video properly
  - next clip button resulted crashes
  - volume slider and video slider works perfectly just as videoplayer section user interaction GUI design and implementation are perfect right now ~!
  - Car selection section removed left over car models when user interacts other sections.
  - news selection section added possiblity to surfe and view original news, as well as some button kept display new texts. 
  - Will make at least another commit to summarize: include android phone screen recorded videos, and NewsAPI small part video to fetch news form online.
