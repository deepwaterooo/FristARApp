- Clean up bugs: 
  - VideoPlayer control when lost track: 
    - Customize TrackableEventHandler so that if videoplayer is playing, when lost track, pause; when get back to be reconnected, continue playing
  - fastfard: fast backward is allowed during both playing and pause, but fast forward is only allow during playing.  
- LeanScale: under control for separating scaling videoplayer from scaling car models.
- Try to clean all bugs that get noticed: 
  - adjust the video plain size/ratio to display video properly
  - next clip button resulted crashes
  - volume slider and video slider works perfectly just as videoplayer section user interaction GUI design and implementation are perfect right now ~!
  - Car selection section removed left over car models when user interacts other sections.
  - news selection section added possiblity to surfe and view original news, as well as some button kept display new texts. 
  - Will make at least another commit to summarize: include android phone screen recorded videos, and NewsAPI small part video to fetch news form online. 
- All major functionalities are finished. One screen shot was attached.

  - Will continueously smooth the project a little bit more (maybe a couple of days) to see if there is anything else that I can do for it. 
- video play part user interaction are completely finished. Will fill in the rest necessary components for news selection section to complete.
- Play Pause function works, interface needs to be improved. 
- will make video user interaction work first, then modify others. 
  - video works only without user interaction (play, pause)
  - car selection secton works
  - news selection basically works, hard coded five news, display in a new plain
  - Others: news API call works, NewsAPI client library works
